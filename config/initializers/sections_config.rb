    intro: "This is the space to sell yourself as a teacher! Tell your potential students all about yourself and most importantly, how you help them to achieve their language goals.I was born and raised in London and am a native English speaker with more than 10 years of experience as an English language teacher. I love helping students learn to speak, read, write and have fun with my language.

    I live and work in Barcelona and am happy to meet students face to face or to teach classes online. I provide both private lessons as well as small group classes.
    
    I have a degree in linguistics from…. and qualifications in x, y, z for teaching…. I am both TEFL and CELTA qualified English teacher and can help all types of students with all levels of learning. Whether you want to learn for holidays and just for fun, or need a professional qualification for your degree or for business purposes.
    
    I have helped many students pass official English language exams, at all levels of study. I love teaching languages and meeting people from all around the world.",
